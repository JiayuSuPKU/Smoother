Quick start
===========

In this section we provide a set of simple tutorials to showcase Smoother's capabilities in data imputation, deconvolution, 
and dimensionality reduction. We will be using a truncated version of the DLPFC/SpatialLIBD 10X Visium dataset from 
`Maynard KR, et al (2021) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00787-0>`_. 
Preprocessed data can be found under the `source/tutorials/data` folder.
